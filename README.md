# dns-leak-test-list
List of websites personally used to test DNS leaks.

- [Mullvad DNS Leak Test](https://mullvad.net/en/check)
- [DNSLeakTest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/)
- [IPLeak.net](https://ipleak.net/)
- [Surfshark DNS Leak Test](https://surfshark.com/dns-leak-test)
- [BrowserLeaks IP Test](https://browserleaks.com/ip)
- [IPX.AC DNS Leak Test](https://ipx.ac/run)

All of the above should provide identical results. If even one website displays different outcome, it indicates a potential DNS leak that needs immediate attention.
